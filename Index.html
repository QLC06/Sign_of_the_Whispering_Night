 <blockquote><font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>June 14, 2023 at 1:08am, I open my eyes ‘cause I can’t sleep from the overflowing scenarios and thoughts. I put effort to remove my blanket and grab my laptop. Opened a new document and start typing these.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>Hello, I’m here to be bold and honest. The 1am thoughts, the overflowing memories, until my mind go through the future. When I started my grade 11 journey, I set goals and one of my goal is to be a top student. My goal was straight until college graduate, my dream, my future job, and the dream to be successful. Funny that one of my goal this school year is to have a man, a suitor. A man who will finally enter my life, can pursue me no matter how long it takes, can surpass my standard, a long-term, and a man who can handle me when I finally talks a lot.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>But things will not go according to your plan, I’m not surprised though. At first, I accomplish my goal to have a friend, I’m also active in the discussions, I am productive, happy, and satisfied. My mind of handling people around me is better than I expected. Pandemic is a good opportunity to learn how to communicate, watch you tube videos, listening to podcast,  trying to have a video call to strangers, and it works. My heart is happy and light.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4> I met my classmates, get to know them better through school activities, groupings, and almost everyday practice outside school. My circle gets bigger as my heart jumps in blissfulness. It is not about the grades anymore, I should enjoy my teenage life as this will be once in a lifetime.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>1:34am when the rain starts to pour as my memories are coming back when everything started. I can even recall the first time I texted my mother and say that we’re just going to eat outside after class(That was the second day of class one week after the orientation). That moment, even my mother is in tears saying that I already have a friend. I always think that I deserve it, all the hardship, all the heart break I felt in Junior High being the girl who left behind. I can’t imagine I’m here where I belong now, where I can finally say that I’m one of them, that they are looking for me from time to time, they are begging me to come, and that I’m required to be there.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>I never thought each and everyone inside that classroom has the biggest influence in my human being in a negative and positive way possible. I explore every cafe and restaurant with them that it will create a mark in my system. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>“We went here before,” me saying to someone I am with and start to talk about that place. When it come to this batch, I became talkative telling a story. Remember that this year(22-23), at this age(16-17), I had fun and I’m telling it from the bottom of my heart that this was the best teenage experienced. No alcohol, no fight, no illegal doings. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>We also went farthest than schools’ town and experience the best, no plans, and nowhere to go. Early morning, I will leave the house just to meet and hang out with them. Weekends is also included, for project and for fun. I am not also used to go home late at night, but then I experienced it for the first time with them. I don’t want to go home, I don’t want to say goodbye as it is the last time. I disobey my family countless time, the white lies, and the tears from scolding me. Worth it though. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>The crossing at Garay, it used to be our waiting spot and now I can’t undo the images in my mind, I can’t even cross that road without teary eye. The time we spend waiting for each other, every step we made together simultaneously, every conversation, Fernando Norzagaray Y Escudero witness everything. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>The bus, it has also a lot of value now. Before school year, the best memory I had was to ride a bus alone for the first time, but now I want to close my eyes when I bus passed by. Remembering every little things and felt disbelief that they can sit beside me for a long ride. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4> And the school itself where I met them. The school year has come to an end and we can’t stop that. In just a blink of an eye, everything turns cold and dark, blue and gray. Every corner became our safe place, became hiding spot, and you can’t blame me if I want to leave Liceo to preserve those memories. But I can't, I will continue to walk through the hallway that once became our path. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>I know after this, everything will not be the same anymore. Grade 12 is approaching, I will graduate at Liceo next year and I don’t know what lies ahead. People come, people go. No matter how attach you are, destiny is so cruel to make things complicated as it is. I know that everything happens for a reason, but I can’t figure out what is the reason this time. I have clues but I don’t want to spoil it, I want to realize it myself. I let myself be gleeful without worrying about the consequences of being too much happy. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>This year, I learned a lot. Academics is important but experience about life is useful. I learn to share, I learn to communicate, I learn how friendship works, I also studied different life and perspective from my friends. I saw them grow, I helped them, I learn how to care about other people but then one thing is I can’t fathom the senses of openness. The sense of telling the feeling, and how grateful I am with them.
</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>It feels like the walls I’ve been building all my life, strong, untouchable, and high, shattered in a million pieces. Opening myself with willingness and letting them know me more than what others think of me. But then, it’s just a part of me. And I’m afraid I can’t show every side of me as it will never be them again. I want them to witness how talkative I am to the people I’m comfortable with, how confident I am when I’m at public places, how angry I am when I lost my temper, how thankful and sorry I am, and lead them in dance practices without shyness taking over me, I want them to witness my expressive side as I am figuring out what kind of person I’m dealing with. I’m already comfortable but it takes time for me to finally make it, and finding the right time to do it. Committing to me is a lifetime.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>3:02 am and I’m afraid I’m going to start buying hollow blocks to build the wall again as another batch will approach to my life, new people, new experiences. I don’t have a plan to stop growing, and learning things from the people around me, it’s just that… I’m back to square one. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4> I will stop oversharing, my life story will be back to it’s memory box or rather just tell to the world through a story. Yup, I’m a writer and every story I made is a part of me. You will know me better than my closest friend, my perspective, point of view, experiences, beliefs, everything.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>Every night it comes with a different scenes,  guilty for not saying that certain idea, shameful moments, hilarious moment, a repeating voices and it keeps repeating… and repeating until I distract myself by grabbing a paper and pencil. </font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>I start to draw as my pencil moves back and forth creating lines and curve, forgetting the repeating voices for the mean time. Coloring those space as my mind clouded by the images from my memory. I forgot that they are my inspiration to keep this painting alive and valuable.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>I turned the music on, all day, just to avoid remembering. But then, every song is about them, every lyrics giving me the best summary of our journey, and every beat of the music is also in chorus to the beat of my heart who’s already longing.</font><br><br>

<font face="Sans Serif Collection" color"#1a0d00" size=4>3:34am and I’m finally at peace, telling all my thoughts through this keyboard, through words, I sort this abstract and made a beautiful piece.</font><br><br>
